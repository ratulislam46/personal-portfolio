            My journey as a web developer began during my college years, when I was in the middle of my studies. During that time, I started learning slowly, focusing on the basics, and teaching myself.
            After completing my intermediate exams, I followed a roadmap to become an expert full-stack developer. Despite facing many major challenges along the way, today I am truly delighted to have successfully learned both front-end and back-end development.

            Now, I have completed a full web development course and gained practical experience with frontend tools. I have also worked with backend technologies.Already, I am developing some projects using frontend and backend technologies.

            I enjoy solving real-world problems by building useful applications.
